## Singing-Voice Separation From Monaural Recordings Using Robust Principal Component
This project contains the Matlab codes implementing the algorithm described in
"[Singing-Voice Separation From Monaural Recordings Using Robust Principal Component Analysis](http://posenhuang.github.io/papers/RPCA_Separation_ICASSP2012.pdf)," ICASSP 2012.

This is done as part of the Audio Processing Seminar 2016.

The MIR-1K Dataset(https://sites.google.com/site/unvoicedsoundseparation/mir-1k) is used.
