Some were made with careless mistakes like the swing function turned up on the drum machine and the tempo was set to 89 on a few of the synth loops. This should result in a slight humanization and organic flavor. Pitch and timbre are indicated in file name and tags. The loops are meant to be 3/4 time but I found that pasting them into a 120 bpm seqencer of 4/4 tempo results in perfect triplet timing... so the drums might be useless for this project. If pasting into DAW at 91 bpm, overlap or cut off the silence or delay trail as applicable.",
