Short explanation of runSuperFlux.py file

>> This script is needed to run the SuperFlux.py (main script of the paper)

>> As prerequisites: 
	-the .wav files must be saved to /dataset/wavFiles (instructions on dataset folder) 
		and
	- readFiles.py must be executed (as described on report.md)

>> After the SuperFlux is executed -> the onsets for each .wav file is saved on output/resultOnsets folder
>> each output file has the extension: .superfluc.txt
