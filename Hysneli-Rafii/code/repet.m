%   REpeating Pattern Extraction Technique (REPET): original REPET
%   
%   REPET is a simple method for separating the repeating background (e.g., the accompaniment)
%   from the non-repeating foreground (e.g., the melody) in an audio mixture. 
%
%   Usage:
%       y = repet(x,fs,per);
%
%   Input(s):
%       x: audio mixture [t samples, k channels]
%       fs: sampling frequency in Hz
%       per: repeating period range (if two values) 
%            or defined repeating period (if one value) in seconds 
%            (default: [0.8,min(8,(length(x)/fs)/3)])
%
%   Output(s):
%       y: repeating background [t samples, k channels]
%          (the corresponding non-repeating foreground is equal to x-y)
%
%	Example(s):
%       [x,fs,nbits] = wavread('mixture.wav');                              % Read some audio mixture
%       y = repet(x,fs,[0.8,8]);                                            % Derives the repeating background by estimating the repeating period between 0.8 and 8 seconds
%       wavwrite(y,fs,nbits,'background.wav');                              % Write the repeating background
%       wavwrite(x-y,fs,nbits,'foreground.wav');                            % Write the corresponding non-repeating foreground
